# myXML
mysql but in xml (simplified)
The goal with this is to be able to manage the database yourself on your own server, right now it is in c# but will (if everything works be translated to java and hopefully javascript with node js)
##Why you may ask?
well as i can't get mysql to work in node js.. well free versions of mysql (that is hosted on other servers).
Which is probably really easy... but this was fun to so winwin :)

##what can it do?
1. connect to a database (by path)
2. create/drop tables
3. select, update, insert, delete

##how
it uses xpath expression to search and the rest is quite simple (save/read xml blabla)
